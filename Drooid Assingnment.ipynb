       "['As Israel begins the first stages of Operation Swords of Iron in response to Hamass October 7 terrorist attacks many questions have been raised about the moral and legal aspects of the war In Gaza units of the Israel Defense Forces will confront tens of thousands of heavily armed Hamas fighters deeply embedded in a large noncombatant population Given this highly challenging setting a core concern is how the IDF can effectively protect Israel its citizens and Israels own soldiers while adhering to moral principles military ethical norms and international law Some have argued that Israel is not adhering to international laws of war They assert that in seeking to destroy Hamass military and political infrastructure Israeli forces have disregarded the civilian populations in Gaza and are causing excessive collateral damage In such a difficult war environment some collateral damage is unfortunately unavoidable But it is crucial to understand that Israel has a legal moral and ethical framework for approaching questions about conduct in war This approach derives from basic principles of Israeli law namely the obligation to respect and protect human dignity international laws of war and the IDF Code of Ethics which has guided the conduct of Israeli commanders over the past three decades By setting down distinct parameters within which Israeli forces must operateafter the war as well as during itIsraeli war doctrine has significant implications for the operation against Hamas Indeed contrary to what some international commentators have claimed Israels military response to the attacks so far has followed these standards and the IDF has taken multiple steps to minimize collateral damage Although the following should not be taken as the formal position of the Israeli government in the current crisis it is an attempt to shed light on the major issues and the general way that Israel views them A DIFFERENT KIND OF CONFLICT On October 7 2023 the last day of the annual Jewish high holidays hundreds of Hamas fighters along with members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad a smaller terrorist organization invaded Israel attacked more than 20 villages and towns as well as IDF military bases and committed horrendous atrocities More than 1500 noncombatants were brutally massacred and some 220 Israeliseven babies and sick and elderly peoplewere abducted and taken hostage in Gaza In addition Hamas launched thousands of rockets at Israel including at densely populated civilian areas in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem There is not a shred of doubt that these blatant acts of aggression fit the legal criteria of war crimes Given the stated goal of destroying Israel set forth in Hamass charter it should come as no surprise that some observers have described the attacks as having genocidal intent In view of demonstrations in some Western cities and statements in the Western media calling for an immediate ceasefire the nature of Hamas needs to be made clear Hamas is a Palestinian militia that governs the Gaza Strip between Israel and Egypt Much of the West including Australia Canada Japan the United Kingdom the United States and the European Union have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization This designation is based on the methods Hamas employs in pursuit of its goals Some may regard those goals as justified and others as immoral and unjustifiable but those assessments are not relevant to the terrorist designation Only the groups methods count Historical parallels do not adequately fit the present situation In the days since the attacks many have searched for historical parallels to try to make sense of the fathomless violence Because Israel has witnessed no comparable act of terrorism in its 75year history some have looked back further in time or have tried to set aside the terrorist or antiSemitic aspects of the attacks viewing them instead as an extreme case of military aggression Hence commentators have variously invoked the antiJewish pogroms of eastern Europe more than a century ago the Holocaust and the surprise attack that began the 1973 Yom Kippur War Such parallels however do not adequately fit the present situation The pogroms and the Holocaust took place at a time when Jews did not have their own nationstate and the Yom Kippur War was launched by a state military rather than by a terrorist militia The distinction between combatants and noncombatants which can be easily maintained when a national military such as Egypt fights against Israel is not maintained when a terrorist militia tries to use urban populations as a human shield To understand the specific values and ethical norms that apply in Israeli actions against Hamas then these historical comparisons must be discarded The opening phase of Operation Swords of Iron is now unfolding Israels war cabinet which now consists of some government ministers and several opposition leaders including some with significant military experience has set and made public the broad goals of the war The government has not offered many details about the kinds of force to be used except for the high number of reservistswell over 350000who have been ordered to serve in a variety of military units Nonetheless it is possible to assess Israels overall approach by examining the general principles that will govern its conduct A DUTY TO FIGHT The state of Israel including its courts and military commanders has over the course of its history based military conduct on several kinds of values and ensuing norms Some values stem from Israels status as a democratic country and as the nationstate of the Jewish people The values of the IDF are expressed in its code of ethics And some values come from international law as interpreted by the Israeli legal system led by the Supreme Court of Israel Although these values derive from different moral ethical and legal sources they combine to form two important general principles in the Israeli approach to combat operations The first principle is that any action taken on behalf of the Israeli state including by its military and security forces must be compatible with the universal obligation to respect and protect human dignity A simple example is the requirement to treat captured enemy combatants humanely in accordance with the Geneva Conventions This principle thus provides a moral ethical and legal constraint on military conduct The second principle which can be called the selfdefense principle has two parts First it encompasses the right to selfdefense if the state or any of its inhabitants is subject to armed attack second it provides that the state has a duty to defend its citizens when they are under direct attack Israel has a duty to defend its citizens against potential future attacks Indeed Israel and other countries have interpreted the duty to defend citizens enshrined in the second part of this principle to hold not only for current or imminent attacks but also for potential future attacks even if they are not expected soon The time for a state to create means of defense is not when its citizens already face danger but much earlieran imperative generally recognized by governments everywhere In turn how this defense is carried out when the danger is neither present nor imminent depends on the nature of the future danger The Hamas attacks have triggered both parts of the selfdefense principle Israels military operation in Gaza stems from what it views as the states right to take necessary action to defend itself and its inhabitants and its duty to protect the latter against not only the present attack but also continuing threats from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad US Secretary of State Antony Blinken underscored this point during his visit to Tel Aviv on October 16 when he said Israel has the right and indeed the duty to defend its people from Hamas and other terrorists and to prevent future attacks Thus the answer to the why question of Israels military response is now clear to satisfy the selfdefense principle Israel needs to go beyond the reestablishment of security on its border with Gaza and eliminate the possibility of any future such attacks But the how questionhow Israeli forces will carry out this taskis more difficult Israels war cabinet has instructed the IDF to destroy the military and governmental abilities of Hamas in Gaza But what does that mean in practice PREVENTIVE ACTION To understand the major goal the IDF has set for Operation Swords of Iron according to Israeli principles of war it is necessary to distinguish between two kinds of selfdefense Examples of the first kind are familiar since we encounter them in ordinary everyday circumstances Say for example you are crossing a park and someone approaches you and tries to snatch your wallet You forcefully resist the person who then runs away In this case the structure of the encounter is clear the wouldbe thief created a problem you used some force and the problem was solved A military attack however often takes on a different cast The use of defensive force may stop the attack thus ending the immediate danger but the problem has not been fully solved The unit that launched the attack may have pulled back but it can regroup and launch another one later Under such a continuing threat selfdefense must have a wider scope In the event of a terrorist attack sponsored by a de facto governing authority as was the case with Hamass murderous rampage the attacked state may need to broaden that scope further The Israeli war cabinet has instructed the IDF to dismantle both the military and the governmental capabilities of Hamas In taking on such a goal Israel is performing selfdefense in a broader sense The problem Israel faces now is continued exposure to a terrorist threat Hamass attack on Israel and its citizens clearly shows the gravity of this danger it will persist as long as Hamass organization in Gaza run by Yahya Sinwar is extant Thus Israel has concluded that the only viable solution to the problem is the complete elimination of Hamass political and military wings Israeli soldiers training for urban warfare Golan Heights October 2023 Gil Eliyahu  Reuters The spokesperson for the IDF has explained the general goals of this eradication operation In its attack on Israel Hamas killed more than 1500 Israeli citizens injured more than 5400 and abducted some 220 of them including numerous foreign nationals every building or site that Hamas used in those attacks or in support of those attacks must be destroyed In other words Hamas facilities that ostensibly serve other governmental functions in Gaza may be assumed to provide infrastructure for planning and launching future attacks Effectively solving the Hamas problem therefore includes the eradication of its political offices as well The IDF spokesperson has also stated that every member of Hamas who was involved in planning or carrying out the October 7 attack must be killed Israels Supreme Court assessed the legality of targeted killing operations in a 2006 decision which in turn was based on international law considerations as well as the ethical doctrine developed within the framework of the IDF I am one of the doctrines coauthors The court found targeted killing to be lawful under certain strict conditions including considerations of proportionality In the case of the October 7 attacks however more than 1000 perpetrators managed to escape back into Gaza and an Israeli operation aimed at eliminating all of them or even many of them in targeted killing missions is impractical given the strict requirement to avoid or minimize collateral damage set by the Israeli Supreme Court the IDF Code of Ethics and the basic Israeli principle to protect human dignity Given this reality the IDFs declared intent to kill all perpetrators means in practice that it will pursue the leading figures because they continue to pose grave danger to Israel and its citizens All other perpetrators will be designated as threats as well based on their affiliation with Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad and their participation in the attacks They will not enjoy a life of tranquility But Israel may need to address the danger they pose to its citizens later not necessarily during the present war Strictly speaking the goal of the present operation is to destroy Hamass ability to launch military attacks against Israel and its ability to control Gaza the goal is not to kill every member of Hamas SELF DEFENSE NOT REVENGE Israels operation in Gaza should not be depicted as or justified on the grounds of revenge No principle of an eye for an eye should guide Israels pursuit of Hamas and its members The major principle at issue according to Israels own conception of war conduct is selfdefense In particular the civilian population of Gaza should not be subject to acts of revenge which are clearly immoral and as a form of collective punishment also illegal Nonetheless a largescale operation to dismantle the terrorist organization that controls Gaza is bound to involve numerous interactions with inhabitants who are not involved in the hostilities Such interactions must be guided by three principles the first of which also underlies the second and third The first is that the IDF must continually try to minimize collateral damage Obviously this imperative applies to the Israeli population as well but in the present operation its primary application concerns the issue of collateral damage in the Gaza Strip and the obligation to protect the life health and property of noncombatants who live there under Hamas control Here two further principles come into play the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality Both are well established as components of historical just war doctrine jus ad bellum and since the twentieth century have been inscribed in international law as well One way the IDF has long sought to minimize collateral harm is by warning civilians of imminent military attacks In previous operations in Gaza for example the IDF alerted inhabitants to evacuate areas by employing knocking on the roof warnings shortly before it attacked with this method and others including phone calls inhabitants would be given multiple warnings of an attack the more the better But under the present circumstances this approach is no longer possible given the scale of the operation and the number of Hamas targets involved IDF units must continue to try to prevent harm to noncombatants who have not evacuated Instead on October 13 the IDF issued a general order to noncombatant inhabitants who live in the northern part of Gaza to move to the southern part since the next stage of hostilities will take place in the north Such a largescale evacuation is required because Hamas has embedded itself and its operations in residential areas and it would be impossible for the IDF to act effectively systematically and forcefully against Hamas without harming noncombatants there In this situation the general evacuation order can serve the purpose of the roofknocking warnings Given the magnitude of Hamass October 7 attacks and Israels clear announcement that it is compelled to make a devastating military response it is reasonable to assume that all inhabitants of Gaza are aware of the situation In addition to Israeli and international media Palestinian radio and TV stations have extensively covered these events Often the IDF breaks into their programs to warn the population Residents thus understand the need to evacuate Nonetheless the IDF has followed the evacuation order with other forms of warning Moreover the IDFs guidelines require that its forces must distinguish between terrorist combatants and noncombatants who have not yet evacuated Israeli units must continue to try to prevent harm to the latter By and large the presence of such noncombatants should be known to the IDF and to the extent possible should be taken into account when it plans and carries out military activity THE DAMAGE THRESHHOLD Which brings us to the principle of proportionality Since it is Hamas policy to blur all distinctions between its members and the general population of Gaza an Israeli attack on a Hamas military target often risks causing collateral damage even when extensive precautions are taken The international press and Western commentators often assume that if any noncombatants are killed in such operations then excessive force has been used That assumption is flawed Of course all noncombatant casualties are regrettable and every effort should be made to minimize them According to the principle of proportionality as elaborated in just war doctrine however the crucial issue is whether the value of the military advantage gained is greater than the cost of the expected collateral damage If it is then the act in question can be justified This holds important implications for the present war against Hamas Israel must seek to minimize collateral damage as much as is reasonably possible But according to Israels own selfdefense principle given the kind of threat that Hamas posesand given Israels resulting need to eliminate the political and military infrastructure of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihadit is necessary to establish a clear limit for collateral damage How should this determination be made Such proportionality considerations can be complicated but the IDF has used a specific process for making them for the past three decades Finding the correct balance involves deep and intricate moral ethical and legal analysis To grasp the underlying principles that determine what level of collateral damage is acceptable it is useful to first consider extreme cases Take for example an enemy site that is being used to prepare an imminent attack that would kill hundreds of people Destroying the site would likely cause the death of a few noncombatants who are not involved in terror activities but any reasonable analysis would conclude that the destruction of the site is warranted For an example on the other extreme consider a situation in which defense forces are targeting a facility containing enemy rockets that are not being used in a current attack but could be used in the future Lets say a pilot approaches the site to destroy it but sees a bus full of children in the vicinity Since there is no urgent need to destroy the magazine and the mission can be carried out later it is clear that the strike should be called off An IDF soldier near Israels border with Lebanon October 2023 Lisi Niesner  Reuters To acquire a fuller understanding of how proportionality is calculated however it is necessary to move from these clearcut cases at each extreme toward the center where enlarging the military advantage of a given action may also require greater collateral damage There is no quantitative formula for making such determinations But qualitative considerations are critical including the extent and immediacy of the threat that is being acted against and the orders of magnitude of potential casualties if that threat is carried out as well as the expected collateral damage if the threat is neutralized It is also important to stress that the IDF does not base its determination of the legitimacy of a given action solely on proportionality considerations According to Israeli principles of conduct the IDF is obliged to minimize collateral damage even if causing such damage is permissible under the principle of proportionality Hence the IDF aborts a large percentage of its sorties because it determines that it can cause less collateral damage by carrying out the mission under different circumstances Finally bringing troops back home is an advantage that should never be disregarded or undervalued in proportionality considerations The principle of upholding human dignity must also apply to people in military uniform According to Israeli doctrine part of the military advantage of a given action must include the extent to which that action minimizes IDF casualties RULES AFTER ENGAGEMENT Much discussion has centered on how Israel should treat the population of Gaza in relation to the major goal of eradicating Hamas Immediately following the attack the Israeli government announced that it was cutting off electricity water food and fuel to Gaza It is true that the enemy can use fuel and electricity for both civil and military purposes but cutting off food and water is wrong because it is incompatible with established ethical principles Adding to the complexity of the operation is the issue of the more than 200 people that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad abducted and took to Gaza This problem demands further analysis of its own but it is worth underscoring the prime importance of securing the release of these hostages both on ethical and politicalmilitary grounds Another key aspect of the conduct of Israels war against Hamas has been largely neglected When Hamas is destroyed and Palestinian Islamic Jihad is eliminated what then Israeli reoccupation or annexation of Gaza is utterly unacceptable In its advanced versions just war doctrine includes norms and principles governing conduct not only during war but also once the fighting ends under what is known as jus post bellum According to the latter principles reoccupation or annexation of Gaza by Israel is utterly unacceptable Instead what needs to take place is restoring security in the areas of Israel adjacent to Gaza and then establishing peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians based on some agreement with respect to temporary borders Any policies that involve population transfer longterm occupation or bringing the territory directly under Israeli rule would be incompatible with either of these goals To build a new peace in Gaza creative alternatives must be sought perhaps even some first steps toward a solution of the wider IsraeliPalestinian conflict In the near term the only plausible option would be the introduction of some multinational military and governmental authority international or regional which could be created by a UN Security Council resolution and that would act in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority and in coordination with Israel Whatever arrangements are made they should not be taken as an ultimate solution to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict The spirit of the twostate solution will need to be revived and allowed to prevail through the introduction and implementation of confidencebuilding measures over a longer timeline But the full elimination of the terrorist threat from Hamas and affiliated groups could do much to set this process in motion Policies of pursuing lasting peace all the more so policies in the spirit of the twostate solution must rest on the practical assumption that the dangers to Israel and its citizens as nurtured and practiced by terrorist organizations have been permanently eliminated',\n",
